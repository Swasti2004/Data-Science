hey all i am documenting my journey of learning data science. all the process will be here.

i will start with python programming first. then i will move on to data analysis and machine learning.

resources i am using:
1. Corey Schafer – Python programming
2. Kaggle – Datasets and competitions
3. Coursera – Machine Learning courses
4. Stack Overflow – Troubleshooting and tips

this is just the beginning, more updates will come.
